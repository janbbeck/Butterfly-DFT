# Butterfly-DFT
This is a butterfly Discrete Fourier Transform in Verilog

It was written for a previous employer who was kind enough to let me share it here. There is a need for better documentation, so if you find this useful and want to share back, please send in some pull requests for better comments. Of course, if you find an error, then send in a pull request for that too :P
